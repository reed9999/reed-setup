# 3 specialty 
# Something about Compiz Config Settings Manager but I apparently never 
# bothered to get it working. Now I forget why this was deemed useful.
# ccsm did not have an apt package.
- 
  - ffmpeg  #Not yet implemented
  - docky   
  - golly   #Fun with automatons, not that important

# Let's hold off on 4-hacking.sh
# That is all stuff that isn't really necessary but, for the next time I'm 
# in the mood to hack around with GNU tools, could be somewhat fun to get the code for. 
# It's also similar to build_stuff_from_source, just less urgently useful.

# 5 translation
# For now I'm just curious if the whole big script runs. Not that important 
# to me at the moment if it doesn't.
# Of course it would nice to modularize but low priority.
