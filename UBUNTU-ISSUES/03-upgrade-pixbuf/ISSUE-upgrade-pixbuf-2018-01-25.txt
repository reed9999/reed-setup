Serious post-upgrade problems. 

On 2018-01-25 I upgraded everything in response to frequent page crashes on Chromium. I only really intended to upgrade the browser but got everything, I suspect. Right after that I got warnings.

Rebooted. Mostly OK. Crash messages upon reboot in unity (see screenshots).
Attempted to fix libllvm5.0. See libllvm5.0problems.txt.
