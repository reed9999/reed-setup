## Concerns

I thought it was suddenly running a lot slower in almost everything. The two most likely culprits would be Dropbox (I did a LOT of reorg on the plane on 12-24) or the hugely memory intensive stuff I did with OpenNML overnight around 12-22 and 23.

First time I've noticed the screen going out and not coming back without a reboot. Keyboard backlighting shows signs of life, but monitor remains dead. Rebooted. Will track this closely.


## History

- 02 terminal wouldn't start with python3=3.6. see file. Trivial.
- 03 upgrade pixbuf 2018-01-25 -- see directory
