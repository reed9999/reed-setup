#Software Centers of various types

I don't understand why Ubuntu even has this "Ubuntu Software" app with the orange A icon. 
It comes up when I search for an uninstalled 3rd party app that it recognizes (e.g. Git Kraken in this case).
It's the ubuntu-software app, but invoking it with `ubuntu-software &` brings up a lovely menu 
of things to install.
When I used that to install GitKraken it was just fine, so apparently the problem is only with 
how it's getting called in the Ubuntu desktop context.
