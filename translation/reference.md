## OpenLogos
- link is dead. http://logos-os.dfki.de/#mozTocId369841
  

## Marie
Deprecated because the whole project seems to be mostly abandoned, the source code won't compile, and 
I'm pretty sure there are better pedagogical uses of my time (like Moses)

- Marie link has changed:
[new link](http://www.talp.upc.edu/index.php/technology/tools/machine-translation-tools/75-marie)

- .tgz isn't really a gzipped tar despite the directions. Change
 tar tvzf to tar tvf and it's OK.

- I had to change the source to add an include.
