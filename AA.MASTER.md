## 2. Current status
- NLTK
  Need to consult book.
- OpenNMT
  POSSIBLY LEARN-READY (i.e., basic case works, ready to learn).
  hard to tell because even short ones are risking overheating my new laptop.
  make really short ones then wait until a better computer setup.
- Do something useful with CMU Sphinx

- CMU Sphinx 
  READY TO LEARN IN DEPTH
  works great! Except it doesn't actually 
  almost there in CLion
- rhythmbox: Mass-installed most dependencies, but some still won't install or build. List of like 8
  I thought tdb (Samba) would fix it but still failing.
- libgweather
  Build depends on something called meson. This looks like a really simple program but I really don't feel like digging into some
  not-very-standard build process.

## 3. Overview
- New Ubuntu computer means I'm excited baout
